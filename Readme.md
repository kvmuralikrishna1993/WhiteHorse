Project White Horse.
====================

The WHITE HORSE is a tool designed to encrypt small files like text files, images, audio files etc. using AES(Advanced Encryption Standard),a symmetric block algorithm. Further it uses Secure Hash Algorithms{SHA256} and bcrypt to generate the hash[digest] using password, which is used to encrypt the data.

#OneWayEncrytion(SHA256 and bcrypt)

#Caution : If key is Lost data will be Lost.

It will encrypt the data by taking path and password as input.
The detail explanation of each line of code is written in comments above the functions and inside the functions.

===============================================================

To run the tool please install the following packages using pip:

$sudo pip install crypto (for Hashing)

$sudo pip install pycrypto (for AES)

$sudo pip install bcrypt (for salting purpose)

$sudo pip install tkinter (for GUI)
